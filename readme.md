## Description

WordPress Popular Posts (from now on, just *WPP*) is a highly customizable [widget](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/) to showcase the most commented / viewed entries on your [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) powered site.


## Features

* **Multi-widget capable** - You can have several WordPress Popular Posts widgets on your blog, each with its own settings!
* **Time Range** - List those posts of your blog that have been the most popular ones within a specific time range (eg. last 24 hours, last 7 days, last 30 days, etc)!
* **Custom Post-type support** - Wanna show other stuff than just posts and pages?
* **Thumbnails!** - Display a thumbnail of your posts! (*see the [FAQ section](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#im-unable-to-activate-the-display-post-thumbnail-option-why) for technical requirements*.)
* **Statistics dashboard** - See how your popular posts are doing directly from your admin area.
* **Sorting options** - Order your popular list by comments, views (default) or average views per day!
* **Use your own layout!** - WPP is flexible enough to let you customize the look and feel of your popular posts! (see [customizing WPP's HTML markup](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/5.-FAQ#how-can-i-use-my-own-html-markup-with-your-plugin) and [How to style WordPress Popular Posts](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/6.-Styling-the-list) for more.)
* **Disqus support** - Sort your popular posts by Disqus comments count!
* **Polylang & WPML 3.2+ support** - Show the translated version of your popular posts!
* **WordPress Multisite support** - Each site on the network can have its own popular posts!
* **Shortcode support** - Use the [wpp] shortcode to showcase your most popular posts on pages, too! For usage and instructions, please refer to the [installation section](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/installation/).
* **Template tags** - Don't feel like using widgets? No problem! You can still embed your most popular entries on your theme using the *wpp_get_mostpopular()* template tag. Additionally, the *wpp_get_views()* template tag allows you to retrieve the views count for a particular post. For usage and instructions, please refer to the [installation section](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/installation/).
* **Localization** - Translate WPP to your own language (*See the [FAQ section](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/faq/) for more info*).
* **[WP-PostRatings](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-postratings/) support** - Show your visitors how your readers are rating your posts!


## Requirements

* WordPress 4.6 or above.
* PHP 5.2+ or above.
* Since WordPress Popular Posts writes constantly to the database to keep track of page views, [InnoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InnoDB) support is required.
* Either the [ImageMagik](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.imagick.php) or [GD](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.image.php) library installed and enabled on your server (not really required, but needed to create thumbnails).


## Installation

### Automatic installation ###

1. Log in into your WordPress dashboard.
2. Go to Plugins > Add New.
3. In the "Search Plugins" field, type in **WordPress Popular Posts** and hit Enter.
4. Find the plugin in the search results list and click on the "Install Now" button.

### Manual installation ###

1. Download the plugin and extract its contents.
2. Upload the `wordpress-popular-posts` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the **WordPress Popular Posts** plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.

### Done! What's next? ###

1. Go to Appearance > Widgets, drag and drop the **WordPress Popular Posts** widget to your sidebar. Once you're done configuring it, hit the Save button.
2. If you have a caching plugin installed on your site, flush its cache now so WPP can start tracking your site.
3. Go to Appearance > Editor. Under "Templates", click on `header.php` and make sure that the `<?php wp_head(); ?>` tag is present (should be right before the closing `</head>` tag).
4. (Optional, but highly recommended for large / high traffic sites) Enabling [Data Sampling](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/7.-Performance#data-sampling) and/or [Caching](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/7.-Performance#caching) might be a good idea. Check [here](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/7.-Performance) for more.

That's it!


## Usage

WPP can be used as a [WordPress Widget](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets), which means you can place it on any of your theme's sidebars (and it even supports multiple instances!) However, you can also embed it directly in posts / pages via [shortcode](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/1.-Using-WPP-on-posts-&-pages); or anywhere on your theme using the [wpp_get_mostpopular()](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki/2.-Template-tags#wpp_get_mostpopular) template tag.

... and there's even more on the **[Wiki](https://github.com/cabrerahector/wordpress-popular-posts/wiki)** section, so make sure to stop by!
